    <div><p class="home-text">Fashion is a term used interchangeably to describe the creation of clothing, footwear,
        accessories, cosmetics, and jewellery of different cultural aesthetics and their mix and match into outfits that
        depict distinctive ways of dressing (styles and trends) as signifiers of social status, self-expression, and
        group belonging. As a multifaceted term, fashion describes an industry, styles, aesthetics, and trends.
        The term 'fashion' originates from the Latin word 'Facere,' which means 'to make,' and describes the
        manufacturing, mixing, and wearing of outfits adorned with specific cultural aesthetics, patterns, motifs,
        shapes, and cuts, allowing people to showcase their group belonging, values, meanings, beliefs, and ways of
        life. Given the rise in mass production of commodities and clothing at lower prices and global reach, reducing
        fashion's environmental impact and improving sustainability has become an urgent issue among politicians,
        brands, and consumers.</p></div>
